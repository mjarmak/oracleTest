// ... substring and subSequence examples...
 
// This call to substring extracts a substring ignoring any
// characters prior to index 7

// This call to substring extracts a substring starting at
// index = 3 and ending at index 7
// (note that character at index 7 is not included)

// subSequence can be used for both String and StringBuilder Objects.
// but both a starting and ending index are required.
